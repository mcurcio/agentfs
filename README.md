# agentfs

A filesystem that records every change an agent makes.

agentfs sits in front of an ordinary directory as a FUSE filesystem. Any
process, root or not, uses the directory with normal file calls and never sees
git. Each time a file is closed after a change, or renamed, deleted or linked,
agentfs durably records the new state before the call returns. It then commits
it to a git branch and pushes at regular intervals to one or more git remotes.
The history lives outside the mount, where the agent cannot see or reach it.

Path rules use git's own files (`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.lfsconfig`,
`$GIT_DIR/info/*`). Nested git repositories are excluded by default.
Telemetry is exported over OpenTelemetry.

It is built in two layers:

1. **Core and daemon**: a Rust library and `agentfs` binary that run anywhere
   FUSE does, with no Kubernetes dependency. The first deployment is a sidecar.
2. **CSI driver**: gives pods agentfs volumes, including volumes several pods
   mount at once.
